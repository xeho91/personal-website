As <Link wiki="Thor Heyerdahl" /> once said:

Like him, I don't see the borders.

My home is <Icon data={iconEarth} />Earth, and I care about the entire
planet.
I treat every habitant equally without any discrimination.
I have been living in:

<Map />

- <Flag data={flagPoland} name="Poland" />,
- <Flag data={flagBrazil} name="Brazil" />,
- <Flag data={flagNewZealand} name="New Zealand" />,
- <Flag data={flagTaiwan} name="Taiwan" />
- and <Flag data={flagIreland} name="Ireland" />.

I don't plan to stop discovering other cultures and their lifestyles anytime
soon.
Astonishingly, little I knew if I didn't start to experience with my own
eyes.
