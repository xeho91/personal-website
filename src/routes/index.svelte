			You may notice me as a <strong
				>big fan <em>(nerd)</em> of terminal</strong
			>,
			<abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr>
			& <abbr title="Terminal User Interface">TUI</abbr> tools. Being able
			to code and solve the cases through it, without the need to use
			<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>
			tools, is very exciting - the core reason is that I can work anywhere,
			remotely on my laptop, without draining so much battery while being unplugged.
			Also, it gives a hacker vibe! Cool, right? You might have guessed it
			right; I am <Link wiki="Linux" /> and <Link wiki="Neovim" /> user too.<br
			/>
			Those reasons mentioned pushed me to become a
			<em><strong>Full-stack</strong></em> developer now.

			At the moment, I feel the most confident in the <Link
				wiki="JavaScript"
			/>
			programming language. However, I keep my knowledge broaden by writing
			code in other languages to be adaptable and flexible in finding efficient,
			developer-friendly and performance-wise solutions to build accessible,
			user-friendly features.

		<Message>P.S. I also love <Link wiki="Svelte" />. ðŸ’œ</Message>
